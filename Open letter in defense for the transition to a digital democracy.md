Open letter in defense for the transition to a digital democracy
================================================================

As free citizens, descendants of ancestors who signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, we no longer consent to the action of the current political system, based on the idea of representative democracy, as this proved to be ineffective in dealing with the challenges that confront contemporary societies:

- According to the Democratic Index<sup>[1](https://www.eiu.com/n/campaigns/democracy-index-2020/)</sup> prepared by the Intelligence Unit (EIU) of the newspaper The Economist, only 8.4% of the world population lives in a regime that can be called full democracy, and more than half of the countries in the world can be considered undemocratic or with serious flaws in terms of freedom of expression or integrity in electoral processes. In the latest data, 70% of the countries have regressed in the indicators in recent times as a result of the current social conjecture.

- Data from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA)<sup>[2](https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/voter-turnout-trends-around-the-world.pdf)</sup> reveal worrying numbers regarding participation in electoral processes. If abstention is an indicator of voters' apathy and lack of confidence in the political system, what conclusion should be drawn from the low civic participation in political activity (…) with a decrease in the average global value of participation of 78% in the 40's to 66% during the 2010s and on a declining trend.

- If it is true that wealth in recent decades has been increasing considerably, it is also true that disparities have been increasing at a steep rate! According to the organization Oxfam International<sup>[3](https://www.oxfam.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Oxfam-Inequality_Report-Time-to-Think.pdf)</sup>, "Only the 2153 richest billionaires have more wealth than 4.6 billion people" – which would be acceptable if the inequality in the distribution of wealth were justified in relation to other indicators of social progress at a global level. that doesn't happen! Indicators from the World Inequality Laboratory also reveal that the current trajectory globally and the worsening of these inequalities!

- According to Transparency International<sup>[5](https://images.transparencycdn.org/images/CPI2020_Report_EN_0802-WEB-1_2021-02-08-103053.pdf)</sup>, ⅔ of the world population considers that the social environment of their country is corrupt, with the global average of the Corruption Perception Index ranking at 43% below 50% and far from 100% that would be considered a society where the perception of corruption would not exist. April 2007, WikiLeaks, November 2017, Paradise Papers, October 2021, Pandora Papers<sup>[4](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database)</sup>. Estimates from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists say that money held offshore (outside the country where the money was made) range from US$5.6 trillion to US$32 trillion.

- According to the Intergovernmental Scientific Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)<sup>[6](https://grow-back.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ipbes_global_assessment_report_summary_for_policymakers_en.pdf)</sup>, approximately 25% of all species on the planet are currently at risk of extinction due to human activity, and if we keep to the current trajectory and way of commodifying nature this number will tend to increase. The biosphere takes between 15 to 30 million years to recover from a mass extinction as fossil records indicate. We refuse to go down in history as the generation that annihilated a large part of it because that is not the legacy we want to leave for future generations. Governments are failing to provide concrete responses to this crisis.

- The impact of human activity on the planet is not limited to the reduction in the diversity of the species that inhabit it. Climate change, contested even by presidents, is a reality with negative consequences in the lives of many people, as studies by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC)<sup>[7](https://www.internal-displacement.org/global-report/grid2021/)</sup> indicate, 24 million people have been displaced due to climate-related disasters and in current trajectory these numbers will tend to increase.
    The failure of political action has led to the rise of young people like Greta Thunberg or Boyan Slat to take action where adults do not respond. While the private sector invests and advances; Tesla, greater efficiency in solar panels, Ocean Cleanup, what concrete measures are being taken by the most polluting countries?

- The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)<sup>[8](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2021-04/fs\_2104\_milex\_0.pdf)</sup> estimates that about $2 trillion (or 2000 billion) of dollars was spent on industry and military action in 2020 alone. International Institute for Food Policy Research (IFPRI)<sup>[9](https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll2/id/132266)</sup> estimates that it would take only between 7 to 265 billion to end world hunger, that is, between 0.35% (NOT 1%!) to 13.25% of military spending!!! And case to say that we live with Stockholm syndrome in relation to military actors! This is an immoral situation that cannot go on! If the objective is not to end the defense ministries, at least 1%, 10% of the funds spent could be channeled towards a good objective!

- In the last 30 years there have been advances regarding nuclear decommissioning and the number of nuclear weapons has been steadily decreasing. In the report Armaments, Disarmament and International Security 2021<sup>[10](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/YB20%2010%20WNF.pdf)</sup> issued by SIPRI concludes however, that the year 2021 saw for the first time in several decades, a stagnation in this process. The study also claims that as there has not been an increase in the number of nuclear weapons, the number of missiles that would have been stored in the past and are now ready to be fired has increased. Still, some contradictory signs seem to persist. England, under the government led by Boris Johnson, which had pledged to reduce the number of warheads to 180 units, retreated and increased production having increased by 10. China, India and Pakistan increase production. We are stagnant. Nuclear disarmament must not stop but advance and all parties must be involved and participate. The advance that has been made must not retreat and the efforts must continue…!! (...)

- The Global Health Security Index<sup>[11](https://www.ghsindex.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2019-Global-Health-Security-Index.pdf)</sup>, prepared by the North American institution Nuclear Threat Initiative and released in October 2019, analyzing the quality of biosafety in 195 nations, found that the average score was 40.2 out of 100. Regardless of the true origin of the so-called pandemic of SARS-cov2, its seriousness, the proportionality and constitutionality of the measures taken by the institutions responsible for the management of public health, and the negative impact on the economy, on democracies and on various other aspects of the way of life around the world is undeniable. There are currently 59 maximum security (biosafety level 4) laboratories and hundreds more with level 3 biosafety in operation, most of which are located in densely populated urban centers. Contrary to what might be expected, the escape of dangerous pathogens from these spaces occurs quite frequently.<sup>[13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_laboratory_biosecurity_incidents)</sup>
    In 2014, more than 300 scientists around the world signed a joint letter calling for a ban on such activities through an initiative called The Cambridge Working Group<sup>[12](http://www.cambridgeworkinggroup.org/documents/statement.pdf)</sup>. The signatories of this letter alert to the real risk arising from the existence of laboratories that use gain-of-function research with the assumption of developing new cures and call for their closure.

- 419 scientists from more than 40 countries in a signed letter, organized by the association 5G Appeal<sup>[14](https://www.5gappeal.eu/)</sup><sup>[14b](https://ehtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/Scientist-5G-appeal-2017.pdf)</sup> and initially addressed to the European Commission, draw attention to the existence of numerous published articles that demonstrate that electromagnetic radiation of certain frequencies has a negative impact on the health of living beings; effects include increased risk of cancer, cellular stress, increased harmful free radicals, genetic damage, structural and functional changes in the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on the overall well-being of humans and non-humans . More recently, the US Court of Appeals for District of Columbia Circuit Judges ruled in favor of environmental health groups finding that the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) violated the Administrative Procedure Act and did not adequately respond to damage claims environmental and public health hazards. Meanwhile, installation of the 5G towers continues at cruising speed across the developed world. Politicians ignore scientists' warnings. This is yet another proof of the need to change the way we (...)

Therefore, we appeal to society as a whole and to all competent authorities, national and international, to create mechanisms, tools, which pave the way to encourage the participation of populations in political issues that involve them and in the generation of consensus around solutions to the key issues raised in this document.

Although humanity's history has always been towards evolution… there are disturbing signs today, and action is needed! The current political failure is essentially due to the distance that exists between political agents and their voters. Electronic voting will perhaps be one of the fundamental tools for this much-needed transition. In every election where electronic voting was tried there was an increase in participation! In addition to increasing participation, it allows referendums to be held faster and cheaper than the traditional method… We must make our weaknesses our strengths… for all these reasons we consider that something must be done…
