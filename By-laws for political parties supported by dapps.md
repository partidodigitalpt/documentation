Urgency</p>

Parallel to the indicator defined above, party members are invited to classify a given policy according to how urgent they consider it to be; irrelevant, of little importance, useful, important and urgent.

<p align="center">

<p align="center">
<b>( article 6 )</b><br>

Scientific-economic and legal analysis</p>

Law projects must be evaluated from the point of view of their technical and economical viability.

It is necessary to ascertain the real need for the proposal, for example; the number of potential users, the medical services already existing in the region, the financing of the project etc.. It is necessary to evaluate the costs, the execution timelines, and compare them because the available resources and time is always limited. The analysis of the policy proposals consists of 4 parts:

I.The first part must present the original policy proposal and a comment issued by the Legal Committee regarding the conformity of the proposal with the constitutional law and possible conflicts in the use of legal terms.

II.The second part, which is a feasibility study, should contain the various technical analyses necessary to carry out the project, such as availability and costs raw materials, estimates for the number and qualifications of technicians, establishment of deadlines, etc., and is to be prepared by the Scientific Committee.

I.The price for the elaboration of these eco-economical analyses is established by evaluating proposed budgets by the respective SCs and the ECs, independently. These budgets are then re-evaluated by party members who may suggest a different price. Finally, it’s fixed by calculating the median from all the contributions.

iI. SCs and the ECs may by their own initiative accept or reject the proposed price for a project.

iiI. The different SCs and ECs that accepted a proposal, are afterwards ratified by the SELC by simple consensus and lastly, party members officialize the adjudication of the work again by consensus.
