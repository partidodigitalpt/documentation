cooperation

The work order attributed to the SC and EC is often complex and expensive thus the **PP **allows itself partnerships between these committees and other private apolitical organizations for the study of complex projects. We define these collaborations as sponsored and they’re valid only as long as they’re approved by the LCDIE when the project stems from a low impact policy proposal, the RCDIE for ordinary and medium impact proposals and the IRCDIE for high impact policies.
