# Remote e-voting overview

  We can divide the process of voting in 4 distinct categories: In-person
paper voting, In-person e-voting, Remote paper voting and Remote
e-voting (REV<sup>[1](https://law.mit.edu/pub/remotevotingintheageofcryptography/release/1?fbclid=IwAR383qoAB3vx5NWwGl3ITId_8nFjzk-er5fxFc4KTQRDTBb97nT9O_ekPu8)</sup>). Electoral processes must guarantee certain proprieties<sup>[2](https://www.attejuvonen.fi/thesis-voting-security-2019-10-01.pdf)</sup> as
well as provide cybersecurity when done electronically<sup>[3](http://www.lsv.fr/Projects/anr-avote/RAPPORTS/deliv1-2.pdf)</sup>. The goal of
this short paper is to do a small overview of the current tools of the
ecosystem of remote e-voting and pin-point key components that will play
an important role in its foreseeable evolution.

**Additional Keywords and Phrases:** Remote e-voting, e-vote, on-line
consensus

## Subject

  Remote e-voting is the ability for a user to cast a vote during an
election, or to answer a poll, from their own computer in any location
with immediate effect. Elections that are run electronically are
important because they are able to generate consensus faster than
traditional voting and perhaps cheaper, considering that the same
infrastructure can be re-used in different cycles.

## USE CASES

  One of the first pilot experiments with remote e-voting was in Estonia
and took place in 2005 for the local elections where around 1% of the
voters used the system. This later culminated in the 2019 Estonian
parliamentary elections where 565 045 people voted of which 247 232 cast
their votes on-line, at home, over the internet, which is about 43.8% of
the total of the votes cast. Estonia is so far the only country to
deploy remote e-voting for national elections across the entire
population of the country.<sup>[4](https://rk2019.valimised.ee/en/voting-result/voting-result-main.html)</sup> To achieve this it made use of the smart
card eID issued by their government.

In Switzerland, remote e-voting has been occurring a little bit earlier,
since 2003, the first time in the small commune Anieres that is part of
the canton of Geneva. Between 10-20% of the total of votes of permanent
residents have since been cast over the internet while for the expat
community it has been registered between 40-70% on-line voter turnout,
depending on the specific cantons.<sup>[5](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283878260_Fifteen_Years_of_Internet_Voting_in_Switzerland_History_Governance_and_Use)</sup> Switzerland uses a different
mechanism other than smart cards for identification however, which
relies solely on in-presence registration at the corresponding cantons
and the insertion of a series of codes that are sent to the
corresponding residential address by letter.

The Switzerland experience contrasts with Estonia's in that it has been
occurring more at a local than at a national level.

Colombian government and FARC in 2016 went on a plebiscite for a peace treaty
wherein around 5 400 000 otherwise excluded expats
were able to express their opinion on-line through digital tools.<sup>[6](https://www.oecd-forum.org/posts/28703-how-blockchain-can-change-voting-the-colombian-peace-plebiscite)</sup>

South Korea successfully deployed a small-scale remote e-vote polling in
the most populous province, Gyeonggi-do, with around 9000 participants
that decided the destiny of 527 community projects. The trial used
blockchain for improved security which has seen strong support for
adoption by national authorities that plan to invest \$380 million
between 2021-2026. The Ministry of Science and Technology plans to
implement DID<sup>[7](https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/)</sup> at a national level by the end of 2022.<sup>[8](https://v.kakao.com/v/20200624165519865)</sup>

Other trials have been conducted with relative success at varied scales
in other countries as the technology behind remote e-voting becomes
better understood. There are numerous examples of private companies that
claim to be able to accomplish this.

## Basic proprieties

The biggest challenge of remote e-voting is to achieve high level of
security under an uncontrolled environment and insecure platform.
E-voting properties and many different classifications that set the
minimum requirements are already established. Some of these
classifications are just the same properties under different names such
as: confidentiality, integrity, privacy, democracy, universality,
verifiability, etc.. Regardless, the goal is always to conciliate two
apparently mutually exclusive proprieties:

### Verifiability

Verifiability is the ability of any independent party to verify that all
votes were counted correctly. Additionally, it should give voters the
ability to verify that their own vote has been properly emitted,
recorded and counted for the final tally results. The pursuit of this
propriety culminated in the idea of end-to-end verifiability<sup>[9](https://usvotefoundation-drupal.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/E2EVIV_full_report.pdf)</sup>
(E2E-VIV). Intuitively, what this system must provide is the ability for
voters to detect fraud by distributing receipts for each vote while
simultaneously preventing these from being used as proofs of their
orientation to a third-party, in order to avoid coercion. Current
practices stipulate that all receipts should be posted publicly in a
secure append-only bulletin board once the final tally is published.

### Privacy

The remote e-voting system must protect voters by concealing the
relation between the voter and the votes cast, ensuring that the
choice's made remain private. This can be expressed via several security
properties <sup>[10](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/629.pdf)</sup>:

- Basic ballot integrity guarantees that no one in possession of the
(digital) ballots can disclose how voters voted individually while still
being able to tally the results.

- In the literature, receipt-freeness means protecting the voting
process even when voters willingly interact with an attacker.
Coercion-resistance, less strongly, is considered when an honest voter
is, during some time, under the control of an attacker. Both these
conditions assume that a voter should not be able to prove conclusively
to anyone else how the vote was cast.

- Protection from social profiling should also be considered by using a
mix-net (an overlay network), correlations between the votes, the voters
and their geolocations should be concealed.

Various concepts like receipt free voting, E2E, third-party
verifiability, etc., led to development of different protocols. A common
critical aspect concerns identity management, fundamenal to guarantee
that each person can vote at most once during each election. The concept
of a PKI (public key infrastructure) helps by providing an easy and
highly secured way for authentication. PKI ensures that sensitive
information is encrypted and can only be reverse verified with special
keys that are in possession of only the voter and trusted entities,
generally with the help of a CA (Certificate Authority).

The whole system is thus divided and analyzed in several phases or
layers. With proper design each layer can be checked as well as the
transactions in-between. Some interesting remote e-voting systems that
offer end-to-end verifiability, under certain configuration assumptions,
that were found during our research were Remotegrity<sup>[11](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/214.pdf)</sup>, EVIV<sup>[12](https://github.com/EVIVoting/EVIV)</sup> and
VoteAgain<sup>[13](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11189)</sup>.

### Public-Key, Zero-Knowledge and Homomorphic Encryption

PKIs are well established cryptographic algorithms and the necessary
underlying infrastructure that can be used to form *secure channels*
between two parties while guaranteeing *confidentiality*, *data
integrity* and *identity*.<sup>[14](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-175b.pdf)</sup>

Although Public-Key Infrastructure does provide some of the necessary
building blocks for secure communications, registering and
authenticating eIDs generally relies on the issuance of digital
certificates from a CA (the government or other public institutions) and
the integrity of these is tied to the good behavior of the officials who
issue and manage the certificates. Recently, decentralized PKI schemes
which rely instead on a *Network of Trust* and *blockchain* were proposed to
mitigate this design flaw.<sup>[15](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15351v1)</sup>

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) are a way to prove to a party that you are
in the possession of some information (a secret) without revealing it
during communications. It's useful for *anonymous authentication* and
consequentially, *private voting*.<sup>[16](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01812004/document)[17](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341000573_ethVote_Towards_secure_voting_with_distributed_ledgers)[18](https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/)</sup>

Homomorphic encryption allows votes to be saved and later tallied
without disclosing clear-data. It achieves this by doing computations on
top of ciphertexts and is useful to guarantee ballot integrity
<sup>[19](https://www.ijrte.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/v8i2S11/B11680982S1119.pdf)</sup> *when publishing a bulletin-board of the votes*.

There are other cryptographies that may also prove to be useful such
as Multi-Party computation <sup>[20](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/\~rafail/PUBLIC/182.pdf)</sup>, as an example whenever guaranteeing
shared trust between members of a small set is a necessity.

PKI is embedded in government issued smart card eIDs.

### Trusted Execution Environment

As mentioned unsecured platforms pose serious problems. We need to
ensure that the applications necessary for remote e-voting are running
in isolated environments in order to protect the voter's machine against
malware. TEE<sup>[21](https://globalplatform.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GlobalPlatform_TEE_Whitepaper_2015.pdf)</sup> allows this by structuring access to hardware resources
separately from the rich OS. With the proper setup of a nanokernel, with
the use of microcode and private keys stored in firmware, namely in ROMs
(Read-only Memory), and assuming a trust relationship between the
hardware provider and the end-user, TEE allows the secure handling of
private keys on the voter's machine and may be used to reassure that the
correct software is running in isolation to other potentially malicious
processes; however, this is frail in situations where backdoors are
hidden that bypass security checks. This can only be alleviated by
promoting open source software and hardware and is currently an issue
given the monopoly of hardware manufacturers.

This technology is implemented in some of the AMD, Intel, ARM and RISC-V
CPUs <sup>[22](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339784918_A\_Clean_Slate_Approach_to_Linux_Security_RISC-V_Enclave)</sup>. Smart cards are also one form of TEE because of their
embedded microchips which are obviously detached from the devices with
which they operate.<sup>[23](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/smartcard99/full_papers/kommerling/kommerling.pdf)</sup>

### Distributed ledgers

The blockchain <sup>[24](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)</sup> is a new technology for storing data in a secure and
transparent way which is not subject to any form of central control. It
provides strong resilience against attacks that can tamper the integrity
of the data by making use of the *immutability* propriety that can be
obtained from distributed ledgers.

The technology is based on a decentralized network consisting of
multiple connected nodes that can interchange data transactions, are
geographically disjoint, have different owners and which operate as a
single database. The design makes it possible for the information stored
in the blockchain to be preserved permanently and without the
possibility of it being modified in one of the nodes without detection.
It also ensures high availability by eliminating single points of
failure (Byzantine fault tolerance) while always providing verifiability
as all nodes maintain the consensus version of the ledger. Smart
contracts are a novelty in the sense that blockchains become not only
databases but can function as decentralized applications (dApps) as
well.

The main purpose of using blockchain in remote e-voting is to guarantee
that the servers where data is stored and processed are not in control
of a single entity (although different parties may be assigned different
roles).

### Overlay networks

Encryption (with the use of PKI) is enough to guarantee some degree of
privacy. However, it does not deal with the risks of correlating the
voters machine IP address, which is present in the exchanged data
packets and which can be traced to specific geolocations. To protect
against this type of attacks a technique known as onion routing can be
deployed by using overlay networks; a network that is layered on top of
another network and used to scramble and hide the IPs.

The basic idea is that the signal between each node of the network is
randomly mixed between a set of proxies, also known as relays (nodes).
This is coupled with the procedure that at each intersection of the
packet's route, information is carried only about the predecessor and
successor nodes but not of the entire mapping.

This architecture if properly setup can be used to obfuscate the user's
source and destination IPs. No-Log VPNs may provide this service but
require some level of trust between the users and the VPN provider.

Tor <sup>[25](https://svn-archive.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.pdf)</sup> on the other hand, is a decentralized trustless solution first
developed by the U.S. Navy in the mid-1990s which provides reasonable
anonymity against non-state actors.

### Endpoint monitoring

Correct remote e-voting deployments must make use at each node of the
decentralized infrastructure as well as on the end user's terminals, of
proper endpoint threat detection and response techniques. These can
range from the use of reverse firewalls and updated software to the
correct choice and setup of the OS, which in particular, should be
amnesic by default.<sup>[26](https://www.academia.edu/31947046/Tails_Linux_Operating_System_Remaining_Anonymous_with_the_Assistance_of_an_Incognito_System_in_Times_of_High_Surveillance)</sup> Additionally, practices such as never sharing
personal smart cards with other users or sharing keys and passwords with
the public are important.

## Identity management

There are currently 53 countries that have smart cards as national ID
documents of which we found 11 to provide publicly available SDKs: in
Belgium, Cabo Verde, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia,
Lithuania, Perú, Portugal and Uruguay.

In 41 other countries in order to fully use eIDs it's required to use
specific software: such as in Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Bangladesh,
Brunei, Croatia, Finland, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Ireland,
Israel, Kuwaiti, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malawi, Malta,
Malaysia, Mauritius, Mongolia, Monaco, Morocco, Nepal, the Netherlands,
Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia,
Somalia, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and
Uruguay.

We know that Philippines<sup>[27](https://www.sss.gov.ph/sss/DownloadContent?fileName=SSSForms_UMID_Application.pdf)</sup> has successfully deployed government issued
smart card eIDs but failed at finding information about the availability
of the middleware. France <sup>[28](https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Actualites/L-actu-du-Ministere/La-nouvelle-carte-nationale-d-identite)</sup> is soon to deploy smart card eIDs.

In other countries no eID service is provided and identification is
mostly done in person and paper based, or dependent on centralized IT
structures that issue a voter eID specifically during elections such as
in the case of Switzerland.

Another hypothetical way to implement remote e-voting is to make use of
W3C DID standard. The only country that has pledged publicly to the
allocation of public resources to this end is the already mentioned case
of South Korea. In this spirit, CanDID<sup>[29](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/934.pdf)</sup> seems to be an interesting
innovative approach to implement remote e-voting in countries that still
rely on legacy systems.

Biometrics may also prove to be an alternative to eID provided by state
issued smart cards.<sup>[30](https://res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/symmetry/symmetry-12-00951/article_deploy/symmetry-12-00951-v2.pdf)</sup>

## Final remarks

The present authors consider that the conditions to deploy E2E-VIV are
to a large extent sufficiently understood and that further investment
should be made. We also consider that with the exception of Estonia
where national elections were already successfully conducted few other
countries are actively pursuing this end. Most need to improve or
disclose their technology in order to facilitate implementation.
Disclosing official eID smart card SDKs in order to facilitate IDM
is important for the ecosystem to evolve.
